Way of clustering, predicting, and training but with neural networks.

what happens is that we have like a bunch of images etc that we need to understand. these images are passed through deep learning models which have different neural layers
and each layer is used to decipher the image, its kind of why it is used for pattern recognition

for example, consider that there is a ml model which is used for security reasons with a face lock. when we click an image of our face, this model is going to learn our face through each layer
and then after recognising the features, it will create a special vector which will be used when we try to unlock the screen

There are two types of neural network: shallow: only one hidden layer between input and output

Deep Neural Networks: incorporates complexity of a certain level; has number of hidden layers encompassed in between i/p and o/p


How the layers work: Input layer: takes the input// this is where the data enters the netw
